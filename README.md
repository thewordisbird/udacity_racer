# RaceSim [Final Project]

### Exporting

Welcome to the repository for the Final Project for _Asynchronous Programming with Javascript_. Click on the [starter folder](/starter) to get started.

To grab the student starter code version, zip and download the `starter` folder.

### Grading

The solution is complete and previewable in the [solution folder at https://github.com/udacity/nd032-c3-asynchronous-programming-with-javascript/tree/master/project/solution](https://github.com/udacity/nd032-c3-asynchronous-programming-with-javascript/tree/master/project/solution).

A promise-based solution is provided.

The student may optionally use either promises, async/await, or a combination of both to complete the project. They may also use callbacks, but only if they are lightly used and do not lead to difficult to maintain or read code (ala "callback hell"), as there _are_ legitimate use-cases for light callbacks occasionally.
